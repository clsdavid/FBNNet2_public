Fundamental Boolean modelling(FBM) has been proposed to draw insights into gene activation, inhibition, and protein decay. This
novel Boolean model provides an intuitive definition of activation and inhibition pathways
and includes mechanisms to handle protein decay issues. To prove the concept of
the novel model, we implemented a platform using R language, called FBNNet. Our
experimental results show that the proposed FBM could explicitly display the internal
connections of the mammalian cell cycle between genes separated into the connection
types of activation, inhibition and protein decay.
